<h1>History</h1>
<p>Archaeological and other evidence shows swimming to have
     been practiced as early as 2500 bce in Egypt and
      thereafter in Assyrian, Greek, and Roman 
      civilizations. In Greece and Rome swimming was
       a part of martial training and was, with the 
       alphabet, also part of elementary education 
       for males. In East Asia swimming dates back 
       at least to the 1st century bce, there being
        some evidence of swimming races then in Japan.
         By the 17th century an imperial edict had
          made the teaching of swimming compulsory
           in the schools. Organized swimming events
            were held in the 19th century before
             Japan was opened to the Western world.
              Among the preliterate maritime peoples
               of the Pacific, swimming was evidently
                learned by children about the time they
                 walked, or even before. Among the 
                 ancient Greeks there is note of 
                 occasional races, and a famous boxer
                  swam as part of his training. The 
                  Romans built swimming pools, distinct
                   from their baths. In the 1st century
                    bce the Roman Gaius Maecenas is said
                     to have built the first heated 
                     swimming pool.
    The lack of swimming in Europe during
     the Middle Ages is explained by some 
     authorities as having been caused by 
     a fear that swimming spread infection 
     and caused epidemics. There is some 
     evidence of swimming at seashore resorts
      of Great Britain in the late 17th century, 
      evidently in conjunction with water therapy. 
      Not until the 19th century, however, did the 
      popularity of swimming as both recreation and 
      sport begin in earnest. When the first swimming
       organization was formed there in 1837, London
        had six indoor pools with diving boards. The 
        first swimming championship was a 440-yard 
        (400-meter) race, held in Australia in 1846
         and annually thereafter. The Metropolitan
          Swimming Clubs of London, founded in 1869, 
          ultimately became the Amateur Swimming 
          Association, the governing body of British
           amateur swimming. National swimming 
           federations were formed in several European countries from 1882 to 1889. In the United States swimming was first nationally organized as a sport by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) on its founding in 1888. The Fédération Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA; from 2023 called World Aquatics) was founded in 1909.
